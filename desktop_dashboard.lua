--[[============================================================
  desktop_dashboard.lua  —  a Hammerspoon tool for Peter

  A small always-on panel, shown on every Desktop, that labels each
  Desktop with the project (a repo under your repo roots) or subject
  (Communication / Matlab / Browser …) of its windows. Finder and
  Terminal windows are ignored. Click a line to jump to that Desktop.

  HOW DETECTION WORKS (and why it's fast now)
  -------------------------------------------
  macOS only lets an app read a window's details while that window's Desktop
  is the active one. So this reads the *currently visible* Desktops (the
  active Space on each display) — which is cheap and reliable — and caches
  each Desktop's label. That means:
    • A Desktop is labeled the moment you switch to it, and the label sticks.
    • ⌘⌃⌥s walks every Desktop, reading each as it becomes active, to fill
      them all in at once.
    • Names from your last session are restored on launch, so Desktops you
      haven't visited yet still show their previous name immediately.
  Showing/hiding and clicking never do any of this work, so they're instant.

  INSTALL
  -------
  1. brew install --cask hammerspoon   (or hammerspoon.org)
  2. Launch it; grant Accessibility (System Settings → Privacy & Security
     → Accessibility → Hammerspoon ON).
  3. Clone the repo wherever you keep your projects. DO NOT COPY THIS FILE INTO
     ~/.hammerspoon — a copy there and the repo drift apart, and you then edit
     one while Hammerspoon loads the other. That is the stale-copy bug of
     2026-07-27; see PRE_CONVERSION/STATUS.md.
  4. In  ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua , point Lua's search path at the clone:
        package.path = package.path .. ";" ..
          os.getenv("HOME") .. "/Git_Repos/claude-switchboard/?.lua"
        local dd = require("desktop_dashboard")
        dd.start()
     (A symlink into ~/.hammerspoon works too — it is still one file.)
  5. Hammerspoon menubar (hammer icon) → Reload Config.

  INSTALL.md carries the same steps with the permissions and the hook setup.

  CONTROLS  (the letters are LOWERCASE — the binds are cmd+ctrl+alt+<key>,
             so adding shift, i.e. an uppercase letter, does NOT trigger them)
  --------
  • Click a line — switch to that Desktop.
  • ⌘⌃⌥ d — show / hide the dashboard.
  • ⌘⌃⌥ n — rename the PROJECT this Desktop shows (blank clears it). It is
    never a name for the Desktop itself — see D76.
  • ⌘⌃⌥ r — restore the saved window layout (move/open windows).
  • ⌘⌃⌥ s — walk every Desktop once and label them all.
  • ⌘⌃⌥ m — cycle what the panel lists: Desktops / claude sessions / both.
  • ⌘⌃⌥ g — pop up each shown repo's GitHub status (on demand; queries the
            network only when pressed). In that popup, click "GitHub ahead"
            to pull that repo — fast-forward only, so it can't lose work.
  • Drag the panel to move it; its position is remembered per display.

  Every panel line whose label is a repo also carries a git dot: RED if this
  machine has something GitHub doesn't (uncommitted changes or unpushed
  commits), GREEN if it is clean and fully pushed. That check is local/offline;
  ⌘⌃⌥ g is what reaches out to GitHub. An empty dot slot on a line whose other
  dot is lit is drawn GRAY, so claude (first) and git (second) can always be
  told apart by position.

  Each line is a NAME and an ICON ROW. The name says what the Desktop is for (a
  repo, under any name you gave that project with ⌘⌃⌥n); the icons say what is
  on it, Finder and terminals last. A Desktop whose label would only name apps
  (Utility, or one app's own name) drops the word and shows just the icons.
  Point at an icon to see which app it is and which window you'd get; click it
  to go to that Desktop AND raise that window (clicking the line just goes to
  the Desktop).

  Drag the grip in the bottom-right corner to resize the whole panel.

  Names + window layout auto-save (periodically and at logout/shutdown) to
  ~/.hammerspoon/desktop_dashboard_state.json.

-- a session blocked on a question shows the same ✳ as one that has finished

-- ---- running a subprocess (every hs.task in this file goes through here) ---
--
-- THE CHILD'S OUTPUT NEVER TOUCHES A PIPE. Every command is wrapped in a shell
-- that redirects stdout and stderr to temporary FILES, which this reads once the
-- child has exited. Three separate measured failures say it has to work this
-- way; the first two are D65, the third is D66.
--
-- 1. WITHOUT A STREAMING CALLBACK, hs.task DEADLOCKS ABOVE ~512 BYTES.
--    Hammerspoon does not drain stdout until the child exits and a macOS pipe
--    starts with a 512-byte buffer, so the child blocks for ever inside exit().
--    Measured 2026-08-04 (Hammerspoon 1.1.1 build 6936, macOS 14.1.1):
--    100/300/500 bytes came back; 700/900/1100/1500 never did.
-- 2. THE OUTPUT IS SPLIT BETWEEN THE TWO CALLBACKS. A 914-byte child delivered
--    511 bytes to the streaming callback and the remaining 403 to the
--    termination callback. Either one alone is a truncated read.
-- 3. A CHUNK THAT ENDS INSIDE A MULTI-BYTE CHARACTER IS DROPPED ENTIRELY.
--    The same child, with an em dash straddling the 512-byte boundary, streamed
--    ZERO bytes — the whole 511-byte chunk vanished — while the termination
--    callback still got its 403. Nothing at the Lua level can recover it, and
--    the titles this panel reads are full of `—`, `✳`, `⠂`, `×` and `◂`, so the
--    boundary lands inside a character often. This is what made the session
--    list flicker between a complete and a truncated view every few seconds.
--
-- A file has none of these properties: no buffer to fill, no chunking, no
-- text conversion, and it is complete the moment the child exits. The streaming
-- callback is kept anyway, as a drain of last resort for anything that reaches
-- the pipe despite the redirect, and its bytes are APPENDED to the file's —
-- never chosen between, which was the bug in the first version of this helper.
--
-- The timeout is the other half. A read that never returns must not pin its
-- guard silently: a panel with no dots is indistinguishable from "nothing is
-- running", which is precisely how this cost a morning. done(nil, "", "", true)
-- says "timed out" so the caller can say so out loud.
--
-- Returns the task WITHOUT starting it, so the caller can store its in-flight
-- reference before the first callback can possibly fire — the ordering the old
-- hand-rolled calls relied on. Returns nil if the task could not be created.

--
-- The Space is switched FIRST and the focus deferred, because a window on
-- another Desktop cannot be looked up until you are on it. The timer is held in

-- be collected before it fires, which is the oldest trap in this file.
-- Raise the window a session is running in, whoever owns it (D86).

-- zooms out to show every Desktop and every window before landing. Reported
-- 2026-08-07 — *"the same response I get when I do four fingers up"* — against
-- a Terminal session line, which switches Desktops with no such thing because it
-- goes through `activate`. So this never calls it while any other route is open.
--
-- The order, cheapest and quietest first:
--   1. the window itself, if it can be reached — focusing it makes macOS follow
--      it to its Desktop with the ordinary switch animation;
--   2. otherwise ACTIVATE THE OWNING APPLICATION, which does the same thing for
--      a window macOS will not let us look up from here (D3), still without
--      Mission Control, and then focus the exact window once we have arrived;
--   3. only if the app has gone, `gotoSpace` — the Desktop is worth a flash.
-- The running application with EXACTLY this name.
--
-- `hs.application.get` must not be used for this: its lookup is fuzzy, and
-- **`hs.application.get("Code")` returns Xcode** (measured 2026-08-07, with both
-- running). Clicking a VS Code session therefore activated Xcode and looked
-- like nothing happening at all. Scanning the running applications costs a few
