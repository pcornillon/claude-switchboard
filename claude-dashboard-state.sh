# claude-dashboard-state.sh — records this session's state for Claude Switchboard.
#
# Usage (from ~/.claude/settings.json hooks):  claude-dashboard-state.sh <state>
#   idle      SessionStart     — a session exists here and has not been asked anything
#   working   UserPromptSubmit — you sent a prompt, Claude is now busy
#   waiting   Notification     — Claude wants your attention (permission/question)
#   done      Stop             — the response finished
#   gone      SessionEnd       — session over, drop its file
#
# `idle` is the newest of the five and the only one that reports NOTHING happening
# (D83). Without it a session that has been opened but not yet prompted writes no
# file at all, and in a terminal the panel's poll cannot read — Ghostty, kitty,
# Cursor — it is invisible until you type something. It draws a line with no
# claude dot, which is exactly right: a session is there, and it is not doing
# anything.
#
# Writes one small JSON file per session to a MACHINE-LOCAL directory:
#   ~/.hammerspoon/claude_state/<session_id>.json
# Machine-local on purpose — session ids and working directories are per-machine,
# so this must NOT live in Dropbox even though this script does.
#
# Why hooks at all: the dashboard can already tell "computing" from "not
# computing" by reading the terminal title (Claude Code animates a Braille
# spinner there). What the title CANNOT express is *why* it stopped — a session
# blocked on a question looks identical to one that finished. The Notification
# hook is the only authoritative source for that, and it is what drives the red
# dot. See CLAUDE.md in the claude-switchboard repo.
#
# Never fails the hook: every step is guarded and the script always exits 0.
# A hook that errors would interrupt the session it is meant to observe.
#
# NO EXTERNAL TOOLS. This used to parse and emit JSON with `jq`, which macOS does
# not ship: every call was guarded with `command -v jq`, so on a machine without
# it the hook wrote NO state file and still exited 0 — the red dot simply never
# lit, with no error anywhere to explain why. That is exactly the machine this
# runs on first, a colleague's fresh Mac. It now uses only `awk` and bash's own
# string operators, both always present (D80).

set -u

# ---- JSON, without jq ------------------------------------------------------

# Value of a TOP-LEVEL string field, from JSON on stdin. Nested objects are
# skipped by depth, so a `.cwd` inside some sub-object cannot be mistaken for
# the real one.
#
# `\uXXXX` is decoded to real UTF-8, surrogate pairs included. Claude Code's own
# payloads do not use it — JavaScript's JSON.stringify emits non-ASCII raw — but
# the first version of this returned "?" for every escaped character, which is a
# silent corruption of a path, and awk emits raw bytes from a decimal `%c`
# (verified: 226,156,179 -> ✳), so decoding it properly costs nothing.
